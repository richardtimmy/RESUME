This code sets up a canvas on a web page and displays a resume on it. Here is a breakdown of the code:

HTML:

• <body>: This is the opening tag for the main content of the HTML document.
• <canvas id='oldSkool'></canvas>: This is an HTML5 canvas element with an ID of "oldSkool".
• <script>: This opening tag indicates that a JavaScript code block is about to begin.
• var db = document.body;: This line creates a variable "db" that stores a reference to the HTML body element.
• var c = document.getElementById('oldSkool');: This line creates a variable "c" that stores a reference to the canvas element with the ID "oldSkool".
• var $ = c.getContext('2d');: This line creates a variable "$" that stores the 2D context of the canvas.
• c.width = window.innerWidth;: This line sets the width of the canvas to the width of the window.
• c.height = window.innerHeight;: This line sets the height of the canvas to the height of the window.
• var resume;: This line creates an empty variable called "resume".
• function relay() { ... }: This is a function definition for "relay", which uses window.requestAnimationFrame() to repeatedly call another function "resume".
• var resumeContent = [...]: This line defines an array "resumeContent" that contains information about the resume.
• resume = function() { ... }: This line sets the value of the "resume" variable to a function that draws the resume on the canvas.
• The rest of the JavaScript code sets up the canvas and styles, and then calls the "relay" function to start the animation.
• Overall, this HTML code creates an animated canvas element that displays a stylized version of a resume, with information about a software engineer's experience and education. The canvas is continuously updated using window.requestAnimationFrame() to create an animation effect.
